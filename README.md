Backport of the Python 3.9
[graphlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html)
module for older Python versions.

Github:
[https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backport](https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backport)


# Supported versions

This backport currently supports Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and pypy3
(tested with pypy3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9).

Support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 is somewhat experimental and due to be dropped
because of the end of support for these old versions.


# Installation

`pip install graphlib_backport`

It is recommended to limit installation of this package to version of Python <3.9 and
use the original implementation for Python >=3.9.

For example in a [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) `pyproject.toml` this can be done
by specifying the dependency as a
[Python restricted dependency](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#python-restricted-dependencies):
```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
graphlib_backport = {version="^1.0.0", python="<3.9"}
```

# Usage

The package works the very same way as the original package.
[Here's](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html) the documentation.


# Development

The sourcecode is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib_backports).
To develop on this package, just clone it, work on it and submit a pull request.


## Dev requirements

For testing against different Python versions, [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
is required.

To download the latest original sourcecode into the repository, there is a make target:

`make download_sourcecode`

*Warning*: This overwrites the code in this repo. By default it uses the tag `v3.9.0`,
but you can overwrite that with a `tag` environment variable.


## Running tests

As simple as running `tox` on the command line.

The executables for all python versions must be in the path, e.g,
`python3.6`, ..., `python3.9`, `pypy3`.
You can install them with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).


## Publishing a new version

Create a new tag and create a new release on Github. This will automatically
publish the package to PyPI.


# Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mariushelf/graphlib-backport/CHANGELOG.md)


# Thanks

I did not create this code -- I only repackaged it so it can be
pip-installed into older versions of Python.

So all thanks go to the original contributors of the
[original sourcecode](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Lib/graphlib.py).

Changes to the sourcecode and the tests: replace incompatible code
(e.g., the `:=` walrus operator) with constructions compatible to
earlier versions of Python, and make the tests pass on all supported
versions.
